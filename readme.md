# Artist Portfolio Project

## Overview
Another project! This one will be pretty simple, again mainly to practice my CSS skills, nothing too fancy. This project is a relatively simple Ceramics Artist portfolio website, I'll be using my name as alias, althought I have actually done simple ceramics when I was in grade school.. So I guess its somewhat fractionally legitimate. 

I thought to my self, the more I practice, the better. Familiarising myself with Git as well is important. I also noticed that these readme's act as a journal entry of my progress, process and understanding throughout.
