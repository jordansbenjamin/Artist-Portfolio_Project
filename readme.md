# Artist Portfolio Project

## Overview
Another project! This one will be pretty simple, again mainly to practice my CSS skills, nothing too fancy. This project is a relatively simple Ceramics Artist portfolio website, I'll be using my name as alias, althought I have actually done simple ceramics when I was in grade school.. So I guess its somewhat fractionally legitimate. 

I thought to my self, the more I practice, the better. Familiarising myself with Git as well is important. I also noticed that these readme's act as a journal entry of my progress, process and understanding throughout.

### Commit 1 (19/03/23)
Added initial markup for the header section including nav.

### Commit 2 (19/03/23)
I added the font I want to use and overall during this commit styled the navbar, I noticed that its much easier tackling the website one section at a time, rather than adding markup for the entire website and then styling it that way. I feel like it would get too crowded. 

But essentially I changed the display property to inline-block to add all the elements in one line together, I also get to practice using classes and descendant combinators. 

I've also noticed the default margins that some elements such as the h1 and the li, I know that you can apply a reset before styling css. However it's good to know here that regardless you have to set the value to 0, otherwise it will stack on top of the default.
